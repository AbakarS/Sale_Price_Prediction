## Sale_Price_Prediction

Hello, here is a new project, 

This project focused on forecasting sales prices in Ames, Iowa. I gathered this data set very well known to data scientists on Github. In this project, I realized all the steps of Machine Learning step by step:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature selection 
- Predictive modelling
- How to predict the selling price of a house taken randomly from the data set.

You can obtain the data by clicking on the link below:
